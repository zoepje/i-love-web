</dl>
expensice (fast good)
slow (cheap good)
low quality (fast cheap)
all three not possible

You might want to make something perfect but if it takes to much time it might be better to delever a less good product
You might use an outdated techstack but if you know how to work it, it might be faster then learning a new techstack.

Preformance vs maintainability => slopy code but fast project vs need code but slower project.

Velocity vs Felxibility => easy/fast but only a few options vs many options but takes longer is harder to use.

Innovation vs reliability => experements vs relaibele income
