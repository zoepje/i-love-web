### What is GSAP

Is a framework with which you can animate UI, 2D and 3D. The depth of GSAP blows me away like all the time.

### Tips for using GSAP

It seems like I stumble on something new and amazing every time I peek at the docs.

GSAP is an animation toolbox. Look into what GSAP has to offer, this way you can maybe find an other easier soluton.
[GSAP Utils](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.utils/) is usful to not write so much code like:

- utils.random()
- utils.mapRange()
- utils.wrap()
- utils.pipe()

Let the ease do the work. You can use [Ease Visualizer](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases/).
