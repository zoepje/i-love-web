## What is GSAP

GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) is a framework with which you can animate UI, 2D, and 3D elements. The depth of GSAP blows me away every time.

## Tips for using GSAP

[Slides](https://slides.com/cassiecodes/beyond-tweening/fullscreen?token=UPwX_bd_#/1)
It seems like I stumble on something new and amazing every time I peek at the docs.

GSAP is an animation toolbox. Look into what GSAP has to offer; this way, you can maybe find another easier solution.
[GSAP Utils](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.utils/) is useful to avoid writing so much code, like:

- utils.random()
- utils.mapRange()
- utils.wrap()
- utils.pipe()

Let the ease do the work. You can use [Ease Visualizer](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases/).

matchMedia() is GSAP's version of media queries.

## Control methods

- play()
- pause()
- resume()
- reverse()
- restart()
