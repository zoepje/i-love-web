1. You don't have to specialize
1. If an idea strikes you as "not right", always (re)consider why!
1. Think about your language (try using your native tongue)
1. The product is the idea, not (just) the output (get paid for all your work)
1. Collect your own references
1. Definitely stay (or like, consider becoming) weird
